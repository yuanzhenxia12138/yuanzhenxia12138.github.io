A little thinking about my future job & current situation in hk.

## Recently thinking?

I saw the video accidently just a moment ago.

The video is about the super power existing in our childhood and we gradually discard it during the progress of grewing up.

Actually, I do not think I will be a programmer for a long time and I do not know what I truely love. A few months ago, I thought I want to be a independent game designer, which can provide me with the opportunity to express my own idea. It is cool, isn't it? It may be the only current job that I can devote to in my future bacause I may not love programming and I have not known what I am really interested. 

Well, it is a real difficult problem that may bother me until in mid-age.


## Plus

I support the hk people for struggling for their democracy and rule of law. I am a liberal. The issue is hypersensitive and so I cannot tell more than this.
