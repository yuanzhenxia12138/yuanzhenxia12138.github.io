"Some people are destined to meet, like blood, like magnets, like stars in the universe. If there is no meeting, it is destined to find each other in the incomplete life."

## What is my thinking?   

The fact is that I met a girl and nowadays she meets another person. The following picture is what they writed several days ago. I was a little moved when I first saw this and I think maybe it is the best relationship I have ever met. To be honest, the realitonship between them looks like what is described in a movie called 'Before Midnight'. The film had left a deep impression on me and as for me, this movie may be the enlightenment of love.

My superficial, ignorant, impatient, impetuous and indolent personality will prevent me from meeting better individual who has a profund knowledge base, a kindest heart and a clear understanding of life. Such expression may be not accurate as I don't know the exact difference between lover and friend.


## What should I do?

Definitely, I will read more books and actually, I haven't read a whole book since I went to university. I should seek for more knowledge rather than be complacent on my only knowledge because of my ignorance.

"Work hard and play hard" will be my creed. I am serious about it.

Finally, the previous story makes me believe that I need to wait for somebody in the name of 'light' and "Some people are destined to meet, like blood, like magnets, like stars in the universe. If there is no meeting, it is destined to find each other in the incomplete life". How fucking good it is. 
I know that life is just life, but the important thing is the way you think of it.

## Plus

Things here on the website are some aspects of the true me. And I will not delete them in most cases becuase these trivial things are cherished fortunes.
