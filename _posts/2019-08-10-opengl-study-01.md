I come here to document my thinking, my experiences and my trivia because I want to find a substitute for Wechat Friendship Circle. Also, there is a reason of the increasingly strict censorship system in the country. I think the current situation is the same as described in the book "1984". Of course, I will keep silent on many things for self safety. 




## What is doing?   

1. Preparing my GRE test & TOEFL test.

2. Working for a C++ CG program.

3. Tomorrow attend China-Joy exhibition and stay in my friend's home in Shanghai for one night.

## Recently thinking?

1. With the bad economic situation, it is hard for me to find a internship also as my poor technical skill (I cannot debug efficiently, I have a bad understand of Data Structure). I have been refuged for several times and I think I need to find for Qide Agency for help, which will cost tens of thousands RMB.

2. I am in a critical period of my life and I often feel anxious for something such as are not able to apply a good graduate program. Sometimes I think I need to struggle for top30 in the US to prove that I have the ability to study in a good school which I cannot prove in my College Entrance Examination for my poor score. In other words, I need to go to a good graduate program to fullfill my dream of going to ZJU in my period of high school.

3. A sentence I like very much recently is that if you do not take a chance seriously, do you hope for the next one? 

4. Yeap, I am good! Keep fighting, keep confidence and keep struggling. ε=(´ο｀*)))
