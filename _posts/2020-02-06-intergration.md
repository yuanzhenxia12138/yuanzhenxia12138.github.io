It has been about 4 months since the last time I update my bolg. So I decide to make a big update.

## TOEFL   

After more than a year of nightmares, from December 16, 2018 to January 4, 2020, I finally got 101 in my most recent TOEFL test at January 10, 2020. The day may be my happiest day in the past year, traditional Chinese year of 2019. In the year 2019, I dreamed several times that I am querying the TOEFL score, with high heart rate and aggravated breathing. It is not a good experience.

It's true that there's no real empathy in the world. Probably only those who have experienced the U.S. application season will understand such feelings. My score is 26 29 19 27. I never think I can get 29 in TOEFL listening test.


## GRE
After finishing my GRE test at November 23, 2019 at Zhejiang University, I learnt that if you want to achieve a goal, even the smallest goal, you need to do it with patience.
GRE test is interesting, even though it is less important than TOEFL and GPA. My score is V 154 and Q 170.
The words in GRE test are useful and improve my English proficiency by teaching me memorizing words in context, as a native speaker.


## The other half

I think it is vital for me to find my other half who have some consensuses in some specific things. If not, I think I may be concerned about it.

So, when can I find my the other half.

## KSP

KSP is a good space game. I am the kind of boy with stars in my eyes.
