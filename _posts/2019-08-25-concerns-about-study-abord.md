As the economy continues to slump, I really need to think some issues which will affect my plan to study abroad. 




## Recent situation   

1. Preparing my GRE test & TOEFL test. Recently, I recited 350 words every day except today. The recent problem is that the time spent memorizing words every day is inefficient because I spend 7-8 hours per day and I just reicte about 350 words. So, in the next step, I need to improve my learning efficiency by taking every second seriously instead of playing my Iphone while memorizing words. This is my second time memorizing words and I hope I can recite 500 words per day in the rest days of the second time memorizing words. During my third time memorizing words, I wish I can memorize 750 words per day. Come on!!!

2. Working for a C++ CG program. In this program, I will gradually pay less and less attention because of the importance of GRE.

3. Never in this period, have I paid such attention on the relationship between China and America. The continued depreciation of the RMB means that I need to pay a higher fee to cover my expenditures abroad.

Maybe, I will call it 'Growing troubles'.


## Plus

I need to work harder and harder! Fighting for my future!
