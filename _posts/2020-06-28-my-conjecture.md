I originally thought that I was going to go UTD to study CS.


## What is the current condition?

### Study

It is not easy for me during the past two years. 

My applications to 18 American good CS universities were almost be rejected all. However, the Columbia University still do not give the result, though it must be negative. I just was admitted by 2 programs: Penn State University and University of Taxes at Dallas; the former program, M.Eng, is about 1 year, and the later one, M.S., is about 2 years. In common sence, the longer the program is, the bigger the chance for student to find a job after graduation is, as students have more time to take pratice on LeetCode and have the opportunity to find an intern rather than find a full-time job after graduation.

But something pretty different happened early this year and still keeps going on nowadays. Yep, that is pandemic COVID-19. The U.S. is currently still in a bad situation, and I hope everything works well. Due to COVID-19, I deferred my CS program at PSU, and then I go to the U.S. in Fall 2021.

In this section, I will talk about some advantages about my current plan. 
1. I will have the same time as those students in 2-year program to pratice LeetCode online.
2. I will have work experience during the gap year, which I will specifically described in the later of the essay. In my opinion, the work experience is pretty important for individuals to find a job.
3. The one-year program will cost less money than two-year program.


### Work

After easy online interview and online examination, I finally got the offer of a bank owned by Zhejiang province dealing with JAVA developments.
If I successfully graduate from my university, I will go to work at July 22, 2020. Hope everything goes well because I have ordered a new MacBook Pro, and therefore, I need salary to pay for the bill.

### Plan

My current plan is keeping practice on LeetCode, and preparing for my job entrance examination to get a good grade in order to choose a potential project, which will be highly valued in the further process of finding a job in the U.S..

Of course, the most vital thing is keep a healthy life, as you need life to spend your money.
