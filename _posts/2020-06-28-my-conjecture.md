To be honest, I'm ready to go to UTD because of my poor GPA.
Ok, fine, that's all destiny.



## What is the conjecture?

Just after I receiving the digit interview from Columbia University, I thought it is impossible for me to be admitted by Columbia University. When I look for something about CG at Columbia, I found someone do the research about something like physics-based simulation and I noticed the almost same thing in OSU. Up to now, I recognize that how technical is the internship provided to me by Professor Liu Xuehui in Chinese Academy of Sciences. I really appreciate it.

Ok, I know it is almost impossibe to be admitted by Columbia University and OSU. It doesn't matter.

My conjecture is that if there is any reason for me to be admitted by Columbia or OSU, it must be this internship.

Anyway, I hope I am full of super good luck!!!!!!!!!
